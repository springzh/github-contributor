I'll search for major blockchain source code repositories on GitHub, focusing on EVM-compatible chains as you requested.Based on my search results, here are the major blockchain source code repositories on GitHub, with emphasis on EVM-compatible chains as requested:

## **Core EVM-Compatible Blockchain Repositories**

### **Ethereum (Core)**
1. **ethereum/go-ethereum** - Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol
   - Primary Ethereum client (Geth)
   - ethereum has 295 repositories available

2. **ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo** - Ethereum L1 Protocol Stack and EVM in TypeScript
   - Contains TypeScript implementation of EVM
   - Managed by Ethereum Foundation JavaScript team

3. **ethereum/py-evm** - A Python implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
   - Python-based EVM implementation

### **Layer 2 EVM Chains**

4. **ethereum-optimism/optimism** - "Optimism is Ethereum, scaled"
   - Optimism has 133 repositories available

5. **ethereum-optimism/go-ethereum** - [Optimism] Go implementation of the Optimistic Ethereum protocol
   - Optimism's fork of go-ethereum

### **Additional EVM-Compatible Chains**
6. **Microsoft/eEVM** - Enclave ready EVM (eEVM) is an open-source, standalone, embeddable, C++ implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine

### **Multi-Chain EVM SDKs**
7. **horizontalsystems/ethereum-kit-android** - Comprehensive EVM SDK (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon) for Android, implemented on Kotlin

## **Key EVM Chains Mentioned**
The search results indicate these major EVM-compatible chains have significant GitHub presence:

- **Ethereum** (Core protocol)
- **Optimism** (Layer 2)
- **Arbitrum** (Layer 2)
- **Polygon** (Sidechain)
- **Avalanche C-Chain** (EVM subnet)
- **Binance Smart Chain** (BNB Chain)
- **Base** (Coinbase Layer 2)

## **Notable Resources**
- **pirapira/awesome-ethereum-virtual-machine** - Ethereum Virtual Machine Awesome List
- Various educational and development resources under GitHub topics like `evm`, `evm-chains`, and `ethereum-virtual-machine`

For detailed contributor information and specific repository metrics, you would need to visit each individual repository. The Ethereum ecosystem appears to be the most active with nearly 300 repositories under the main Ethereum organization, while Optimism also shows significant development activity with over 130 repositories.

Given your background in blockchain research and product management, these repositories would provide comprehensive insights into EVM implementation patterns, Layer 2 scaling solutions, and cross-chain compatibility approaches.
